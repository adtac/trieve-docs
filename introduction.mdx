# Trieve Documentation

Trieve is infrastructure for building performant search, recommendations, and RAG experiences.

Semantic search and RAG are powerful primitives, but can take months to implement and deploy when accounting for all the little details like **chunking, maximal marginal relevance, filters, weighting, model-selection, and more.**
With Trieve, you can complete and deploy a ChatGPT like experience or a semantic search engine on your data in a matter of hours.

Build semantic search and RAG **fast**.

We have deployed Trieve for production datasets of YCombinator companies.
