We believe that users should have control over how they chunk their data. Therefore, we provide an easy interface for users to upload their chunks individually.

## Uploading Individual Chunks to Trieve

The main route that we expose to handle this functionality is our [create chunk route](/api-reference/chunk/create-or-upsert-chunk-or-chunks).

### Important Parameters

- **`chunk_html`**: This is the content that will be embedded and made searchable. You can pass HTML here, and our service will automatically clean it for the embeddings.
- **`chunk_vector`**: This allows you to provide your own pre-calculated embeddings. Use this if you have already calculated embeddings for your dataset and want to migrate them to Trieve.
- **`group_ids` and `group_tracking_ids`**: These fields let you specify a group to associate the chunks with, useful for linking multiple chunks from one document.
- **`link`, `location`, `tag_set`, and `time_stamp`**: These fields are indexed to enable fast filtering of chunks based on these attributes.
- **`metadata`**: This field allows you to include any arbitrary metadata in the form of a JSON object with the chunk. 
<Note>
For the best filtering performance, we recommend using the `link`, `location`, `tag_set`, and `time_stamp` rather than the metadata field as there are dedicated indexes for these. The metadata has an index built on it, but it is only optimized for match queries
</Note>
- **`tracking_id`**: This field allows you to assign an arbitrary ID to the chunk, aiding in coordination with your database system. You can search for chunks using this ID.
- **`weight`**: This field allows you to assign a weight to the chunks, which can influence the chunk's ranking within search results. This is similar to merchandising features on other platforms.


## Example Create Chunk Request
<Note>
Whenever you make a request to the Trieve API, you need to include the `TR-Dataset` header with your dataset ID and the `Authorization` header with your API key.
</Note>

```json
POST /api/chunk
Headers:
{
    "TR-Dataset": "<Your Dataset ID>",
    "Authorization": "<Your API Key>"
}
Body:
{
    "chunk_html": "EcoFusion Technologies provides innovative, eco-friendly technology solutions. We specialize in renewable ...",
    "link": "https://example.com",
    "tracking_id": "134",
    "image_urls": ["https://example.com"],
    "tag_set": ["324", "product", "sale"],
    "metadata": {
      "phone_number": "000-000-0000",
      "price_range": "$21-$25",
      "reviews_count": "15",
      "address": {
        "city": "Austin",
        "country": "United States",
        "state": "Texas",
