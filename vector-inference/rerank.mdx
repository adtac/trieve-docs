## What is a Reranker / CrossEncoder?

A `Reranker` model provides a powerful semantic boost to the search quality of any keyword or vector search system without requiring overhauls or intensive replacing.

## Using Rerankers with Trieve Vector Inference

<Steps>
<Step title="Update embedding_models.yaml">
To use a reranker model with Trieve Vector Inference, you will need to update your embedding_models.yaml file

```yaml embedding_models.yaml
...
models:
  ...
  my-reranker-model:
    replicas: 1
    revision: main
    modelName: BAAI/bge-reranker-large
...
```
</Step>

<Step title="Upgrade your TVI cluster">
Update TVI to include your models

```bash
helm upgrade -i vector-inference \
  oci://709825985650.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/trieve/trieve-embeddings \
    -f embedding_models.yaml
```
</Step>

<Step title="Get embeddings endpoint">
```sh
kubectl get ing
```

```
NAME                                              CLASS   HOSTS   ADDRESS                                                                 PORTS   AGE
